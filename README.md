# REF1256-N64-GameBooster-Clone
An open source clone of the Datel GameBooster for the Nintendo 64

This is a fully functional Nintendo 64 GameBooster clone. It implements the original LZ9FC17 GAL on an Altera EPM570, and fully supports all functionality to include: loading Gameboy cartridges and the GS button.

This is compatible with the Sanni Cartridge Reader's N64 Gameshark programming function.

The 2x5 10 pin connector is mapped to the standard Altera USB Blaster pinout for programming. Happy making.

PCB Thickness: 1.2 mm
